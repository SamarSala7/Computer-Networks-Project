Networks Project Description
     HTTP SERVER

Requirements:
Implement part of the HTTP protocol.
– Threaded (multiple clients)
– GET only.
– Error handling
• Page Not found
• Bad Request
• Redirection
• Internal Server Error

Starting the Server
Accept multiple clients by starting a thread for 
each accepted connection.
• Keep on accepting requests from the remote 
client until the client closes the socket (sends a 
zero length message)
• For each received request, the server must 
reply with a response.

Receiving Request
 The received request must be a valid HTTP 
request, else return 400 Bad Request
– Check single space separating the request line 
parameters.
• Method URI HTTPVersion
– Check blank line separating the header lines and 
the content, even if the content is empty
– Check valid URI
– Check at least request line and host header and 
blank lines exist.

Response Headers
• The response should include the following 
headers:
– Content-Type:
• We will use only text/html
– Content-Length:
• The length of the content
– Date:
• Current DateTime of the server
– Location:
• Only if there is redirection.

Handling Request
• Using Configuration.RootPath, map the URI to 
the physical path
– Example: configuration.RootPath= 
“c:\intepub\wwwroot\fcis1” and URI = 
“/aboutus.html” then physical path= 
“c:\intepub\wwwroot\fcis1\aboutus.html”

Redirection
• If the URI exists in the 
configuration.RedirectionRules, then return 
301 Redirection Error and add location header 
with the new redirected URI.
• The content should be the content of the 
static page “redirect.html”

Not Found
• If the physical file is not found return 404 Not 
Found error.
• The content should be the content of the 
static page “Notfound.html”

Bad Request
• If there is any parsing error in the request, 
return 400 Bad Request Error.
• The content should be loaded with the 
content of the static page “BadRequest.html”
Internal Server Error
• If there is any unknown exception, return 500 

Internal Server Error.
• The content should be the content of the 
static page “InternalError.html”

TEMPLATE WALKTHROUGH 
SERVER DEMO
Project Running
• Run the server
• Try the following URIs in the web browser:
http://localhost:1000/aboutus2.html
should display aboutus2.html page
http://localhost:1000/aboutus.html
should display aboutus2.html (redirection)
http://localhost:1000/main.html
should display main page
http://localhost:1000/blabla.html
should display 404 page
